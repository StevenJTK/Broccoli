         <p class="text">
          
          The vitamins and minerals listed below are some of the most important compotents to a healthy functioning body. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps protect cells. These combat free radicals, which in turn help combat heart disease & cancer, among other diseases.
		  Vitamin K1's primary role for the human body is that it aids blood clotting and can be found in of course broccoli, but also sprouts! Vitamin B9 is a very important vitamin as it helps to remove harmful effects on the human body, such as homocysteine. Homocysteine in large quantities can be incredibly harmful.
	       Moving on to potassium, it acts as a binder for cells to help maintain a good fluid level within the cell itself. Fun fact, sodium does the opposite of this, in which it maintains normal fluid levels outside of the cell.
		   Manganese is a very important mineral as it helps the body's connectivite tissue, bones and sex hormones, as well as fat & carbohydrate metabolism, calcium absorption and blood sugar regulation. To top it all of, it is also crucial for brain & nerve function.
